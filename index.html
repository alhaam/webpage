      <div class="description">The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Allaah wrote down the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.”  </div>
	  <div>1.	Allah is above the heavens – Allah is above His Throne and His Throne is above the 7 heavens. We can’t go above the 7 heaven to see Him. We don’t have the means and the power to go there to see Him or His powerful Throne. But Allah the creator of this whole universe and 7 heavens is able to see everything and everyone and hear everything and everyone and maintain his creation from His Powerful Throne.
2.	Part of the test of life – Allah said in the Quran that he send mankind on this earth only for test and if we see Him then it’s not a test, everyone would believe in Him and worship him
3.	Seeing Allah is the greatest reward – Allah is the most beautiful, Allah said in the Quran And in hadith.. Allah is the most beautiful. In paradise seeing Allah.
4.	Seeing Allah is the greatest honor – If you see the president of a country in front of you in your real life then you feel honored how honor will you feel if you see the creator of this universe…
5.	Human eyes can’t encompass Allah – In Islam we always says “Allahu Akbar” which means Allah is bigger than anything you can think of, he is bigger than this universe, he is bigger than the earth , the starts and everything you see. Can you see this universe so how you will see Allah? Our vision will not be able to encompass, Allah said in the Quran ” no vision…” you can say, why not just see some, well then you will be confused, it would be like old people about the elephant..
6.	Not capable of – Allah is so powerful, Allah mentioned about him , he is so powerful, he created the sun and the star and the universe so how powerful you think he is. can you look at the sun in your naked eyes you can’t you will be blind.
7.	Allah is not in His creation – We can’t see Allah because He is not in His creation, as many people think that God is everywhere. He is above His creation above His Throne.
8.	This is Allah’s Wills and He does what He wants – Allah willed that we will not be able to see Him in this world. In the hereafter the believers will be able to see Allah.
